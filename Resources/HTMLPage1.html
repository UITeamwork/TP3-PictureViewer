                    <u>By Keyword :</u> 
                    <br />Lets you filter the photos you see by a keuword search.
                    For example, if you search "dog", you will see all images that have "dog" in their keywords.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <u>By Date interval :</u><br /> Lets you filter the photos you see by the date they were published.

                    <u>#note:</u> it doesn't work if you put both date picker to the same date, because the hour is set automaticly to midnight.<br /><br />
